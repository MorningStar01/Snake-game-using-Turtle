# Description
This is a one or two days project for a beginner who want to learn python and do a little fun game.I use turtle module for self improvement and I chose to make this game without pygame (for exemple).

# How to play
-Just get the test.py file.

-Keyboard controls by default are W, A, S, D but you can change those in the code with what you want.

scr.onkeypress(go_up, "w")
scr.onkeypress(go_down, "s")
scr.onkeypress(go_left, "a")
scr.onkeypress(go_right, "d")

- You can change the difficulty by modify the value of "dy".
 " dy -= 0.007 "

# TODO
-Add players ( with nickname and scores )
-TBA
